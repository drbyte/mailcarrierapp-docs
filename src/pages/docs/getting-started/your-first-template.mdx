Everything in MailCarrier goes around two concepts: **Layouts** and **Templates**.

### Layouts

Layouts are shared views that can be reused across your templates. They are *not required* to create a template, but generally recommended.  
A layout will contain the basic HTML structure and everything that should be shared such as **header** and **footer**. By doing so, in your templates you can focus on the actual content.

By default new layouts have a HTML skeleton, feel free to edit as you wish, just remember to place `{include content}` wherever you want to render your template content.

### Templates

Templates are the actual core of MailCarrier: they contains the email content and all the related design.

On creation it will automatically generate a `slug` based on the template name: you will use this value to populate the `template` variable when sending a mail.
