Everything in MailCarrier goes around two concepts: **Layouts** and **Templates**.

### Layouts

Layouts are shared views that can be reused across your templates. They are *not required* to create a template, but generally recommended.  
A layout will contain the basic HTML structure and everything that should be shared such as **header** and **footer**. By doing so, in your templates you can focus on the actual content.  

<Image src="/images/default-layout-content.png" alt="Default layout content" />

By default new layouts have a HTML skeleton, feel free to edit as you wish, just remember to place `{include content}` wherever you want to render your template content.

### Templates

Templates are the actual core of MailCarrier: they contains the email content and all the related design.

<Image src="/images/template-example.png" alt="Example of a template" />

On creation it will automatically generate a `slug` based on the template name: you will use this value to populate the `template` variable when sending a mail.

When making the HTTP request to send a mail, it's easier to read and understand what the template `welcome` refers to, if compared to a UUID ðŸ”–

### Syntax

If you're familiar with the most popular JS frameworks, such as *Vue* or *Svelte*, you will find the syntax very easy and friendly: [**Latte**](https://latte.nette.org/en/syntax) is being used as template engine, providing a fast and expressive way to write your templates.  

On top of it, MailCarrier applies a layer to simplify it even more to who is not familiar with PHP: take a look at the following examples. Of course you can use one or both syntaxes, as you wish.

This sections only covers a few examples, but Latte offers a lot more: find out everything about the syntax on their [official documentation](https://latte.nette.org/en/syntax).

### Displaying variable

```html
Hello, {{ name }}!

<a href="{{ callToAction.url }}">
  {{ callToAction.label }}
</a>
```

Is the equivalent of (Latte):

```html
Hello, {$name}!

<a href="{$callToAction['url']}">
  {$callToAction['label']}
</a>
```

### Applying filters

```html
Hello, {{ name|capitalize }}!

<a href="{{ callToAction.url }}">
  {{ callToAction.label }}
</a>
```

Is the equivalent of (Latte):

```html
Hello, {$name}!

<a href="{$callToAction['url']}">
  {$callToAction['label']}
</a>
```

You can read more on Filters [here](https://latte.nette.org/en/filters).

### Attributes

You can mix as well both syntaxes, for example by using attributes and variables together.  

```html
<ul n:if="$items">
	<li n:foreach="$items as $item">{{ item|capitalize }}</li>
</ul>
```
