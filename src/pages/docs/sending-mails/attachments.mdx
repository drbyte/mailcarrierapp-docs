MailCarrier allows to send one or more attachments with your email. To get started simply specify the `attachments` array key and connect it to your file.  
Remember that we're working with files, so you must send a `form-data` and not a json. This is an example of how it looks like on *Postman*:

<Image src="/images/attachments-form-data-postman.png" alt="Attachments on Postman" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Files types">
By default only specific mimetypes are allowed for security reasons, such as *zip*, *pdf*, *images* and so on. You can learn more about this in the [configuration section](/docs/configuration/attachments).
