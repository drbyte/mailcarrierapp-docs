To start sending emails, after you [created a template](/docs/getting-started/your-first-template), you should invoke the `POST /api/send` endpoint, for example:

```bash
curl -XPOST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxx' \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"recipient":"foo@example.org","subject":"My first email","template":"welcome"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/send
```

That's it. These above are the **only 4 required fields**, explained:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100px"><code>recipient</code></td>
      <td>The email recipient. It could be a single value or an array of values when using <code>recipients</code> instead.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>subject</code></td>
      <td>The subject of the email.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>template</code></td>
      <td>The slug of the template to be used.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Sender

By default MailCarrier will use, as sender, the values defined by your environment variables `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME` (which can be empty).  
You can override these values at runtime when making an API call by defining the `sender` property:

```js
{
  // Other variables
  "sender": "sender@example.org"
}
```

Or, specifying the name too:

```js
{
  // Other variables
  "sender": {
    "email": "sender@example.org",
    "name": "Sender name"
  }
}
```

### Trigger

You can specify a **trigger** to know what application sent that specific email. It's just a plain text field, used only for display and search purposes, but can be very useful when using MailCarrier in a multi-services architecture to keep track of who-sent-what.

```js
{
  // Other variables
  "trigger": "App 1"
}
```

### Authentication

By default the API endpoint is protected by **Laravel Sanctum**, an authentication system based on tokens.  
To generate a new token you can run the `mailcarrier:token` command and specify a name (e.g. `My service`) to quickly understand who's using it. 

```js
php artisan mailcarrier:token
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Local authentication">
  If you don't want to use an authentication system on your local machine, you can leave the `MAILCARRIER_AUTH_GUARD` env blank.
</Aside>

#### Other authentication methods

If you don't like the default token-based authentication system or want to use something else, you can install one of the several authentication packages available for Laravel or [build your own](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/authentication#adding-custom-guards).  

For example, you may want to add Machine-to-Machine SSO authentication such as [FusionAuth](https://github.com/danilopolani/laravel-fusionauth-jwt): just follow the README instructions and update the `MAILCARRIER_AUTH_GUARD` env.
